```

## Architecture

- **No build step** — files are served directly by FastAPI's `StaticFiles` mount. Edit and reload
- **No framework** — vanilla JS with a global `state` object, centralized `api` client, and manual DOM rendering
- **Tailwind CSS** — configured inline in `index.html` via local JIT compiler (`static/vendor/tailwind/tailwindcss.js`). Custom colors: `primary`, `dark-900` through `dark-600`
- All scripts are loaded via `<script>` tags in `index.html` — view files share the global scope

## View Lifecycle

Each view has two functions in `static/js/views/{name}.js`:

1. `renderXxxView()` — returns an HTML string (no side effects)
2. `initXxxView()` — attaches event handlers, fetches data, starts polling

`showView()` in `app.js` orchestrates: sets `state.currentView`, updates nav active state, calls `render`, injects into `#view-container`, then calls `init`. The player view also calls `teardownPlayerView()` on exit to clean up audio resources.

## State & API

- Global `state` object holds current view, selected book/job, voice, audio settings, and library list
- `api` object in `app.js` wraps JSON-oriented `fetch()` calls with async methods — use `api.xxx()` for JSON requests
- Raw `fetch()`, `new Audio()`, and element `src` assignment are acceptable for binary streams such as chapter audio, voice previews, and cover/media URLs
- View-local state (e.g., `dashboardState`, `playerState`) is a module-level object in the view file

## DOM Safety

- Use `textContent` (not `innerHTML`) when inserting user-provided text (titles, authors, chapter text)
- `innerHTML` is acceptable only for trusted template strings built from code-controlled values
- Inline `onclick` handlers reference global functions — keep handler functions at module scope
